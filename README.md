# **DANN-4-Ti**  
**Achieving Record-Low Elastic Modulus in Î² Titanium Alloys Designed using Domain Adversarial Neural Network**

## **1. Python Version Requirement**
- The project is designed to work with **Python 3.10**.

## **2. Data Generation Instructions**
- Please use the model generated by the `Ms.py` file to **generate virtual data** for the **target domain** within the desired **composition range**.

## **3. Domain Adaptation Strength Adjustment**
- It is recommended to adjust the **domain adaptation strength** according to the **scale changes** in the target domain.
- **Note**: Be cautious to avoid disrupting the balance between **domain adaptation** and **regression**.

## **4. Data Scale and Iteration**
- It is suggested to maintain the data quantity of the **target domain** and the **source domain** at the same scale.
- You can iteratively update the **target domain** and the model based on the recommendations from **genetic algorithm**.

## **5. Data Available**
- data can be obtained from the **corresponding author or supplementary materials of the paper**. 

## **6. Contact Information**
- For any further inquiries or additional requirements, please contact the **corresponding author**.
